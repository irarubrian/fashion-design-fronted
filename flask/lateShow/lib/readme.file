>The Late Show API is a Flask-based REST API that allows you to manage late show episodes, guests, and their appearances.
>This application is designed to track the episodes of a show, the guests who appear, and the ratings of those appearances.
>It utilizes SQLAlchemy for database management and Flask-Migrate for handling database migrations.

Features
>Episode Management: Retrieve all episodes or a specific episode by its ID.

>Guest Management: Retrieve a list of all guests on the show.

>Appearance Management: Create new appearances of guests on specific episodes with ratings.

>Validation: Ensures data integrity, such as rating limits and related episode and guest existence.

Technologies Used

>Flask: A micro web framework for Python.

>SQLAlchemy: ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for managing the database.
